This is to collect random notes and other file contents that it doesn't necessarily make sense to symlink here. (I was on the fence with vim_after_syntax_lisp.)

# Neovim

I use a mix of vim and neovim, and try to keep my configs the same between them...

In ~/.config/nvim/ I made init.vim with the following content:

set runtimepath^=~/.vim runtimepath+=~/.vim/after
let &packpath=&runtimepath
source ~/.vimrc

This keeps neovim using my same vim settings properly while still being able to use neovim stuff like Lua.

In ~/.config/nvim/plugin/ I made init.lua with the following content:

local o = vim.opt
-- shortcut to set things like o.number = true instead of set number.

-- nvim-lspconfig for gdscript
require("lspconfig")["gdscript"].setup({
  name = "godot",
  cmd = vim.lsp.rpc.connect("127.0.0.1", 6005),
})

-- nvim-dap for debugging:
local dap = require("dap")
dap.adapters.godot = {
  type = "server",
  host = "127.0.0.1",
  port = 6006,
}
dap.configurations.gdscript = {
  {
    type = "godot",
    request = "launch",
    name = "Launch scene",
    project = "${workspaceFolder}",
    launch_scene = true,
  },
}


This is mainly for godot support. I can launch

nvim --listen /tmp/godot.pipe

And godot will open files into my vim session instead of its kind of crappy internal editor.

## LSP Server

Also for Neovim, I setup an LSP server I think also for godot support.
I used: https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig

It was cloned into ~/.config/nvim/pack/nvim/start/

I also used: https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap
