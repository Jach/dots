These are plugins I use with vim / neovim. (ls .vim/bundle/ | less).

ale
claude.vim
nerdcommenter
slimv
vim-abolish
vim-bbye
vim-buftabline
vim-eunuch
vim-fugitive
vim-grepper
vim-obsession
vim-repeat
vim-rooter
vim-sexp
vim-sexp-mappings-for-regular-people
vim-surround
vim-table-mode
vim-windowswap

I might not make use of all of them all the time, but I at least find value in most of them.

I've tried on other machines or in the past but don't currently use:

# nimrod.vim
# vim-javascript

# things I should try (again) and decide whether they're useful:
# neocomplete
# nerdtree-plugin
# tagbar
